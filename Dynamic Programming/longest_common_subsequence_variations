1. Diff Utility - difference between two files, used in git

2. Minimum insertions and deletions to convert s1 into s2 :
    like , s1 = "GEEK" & s2 = "GEFK" . minimum 1 deletion and
    1 insertion required.

3. Shortest Common Supersequence : like , s1 = "GEEK" & s2 = 
    "GEFK". One Shortest Common Supersequence is "GEEFK".

4. Longest Palindromic Subsequence : s = "GEEKSFORGEEKS" , 
    length of LPS is 5 (EESEE, or EEFEE, etc).
    How we can solve it, take t = "SKEEGROFSKEEG" (reverse of
    s) , then find longest common subsequence.

5. Longest Repeating Subsequence : let s = "AABB", LRS is 2.
    How we can solve it, take t = "AABB" , now find same character
    in both strings at different index.

6. Space Optimized DP solution of LCS .

7. Printing LCS
