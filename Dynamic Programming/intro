Dynamic Programming:
    - an optimization over plain recursion.
    * plain recursion : solve problem of size n, by using subproblem of size less than n.
                        call the problem for subproblem using recursion and use their solution.
    - Idea : is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when there are overlapping subproblems.

    Implementation :
        1.) Memoization(Top Down)
        2.) Tabulation(Bottom Up)

    Applications :
        solutions of many problems are based on DP
        - Bellman Ford Algorithm
        - Floyd Warshall Algorithm (find shortest distance between every pair of vertex in graph)
        - Diff Utility (based on Longest Common Subsequence problem) (to find difference between two files, used in Git)
        - Search Closed Words (based on Edit Distance problem)
        - Resource Allocation (0-1 knapsack)
